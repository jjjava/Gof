-Chapter I
	[]OO
	-Classes
	-Methods
	-Polymorphism
	-Inheritance
	-Interface
	
-Chapter II
	[]Singleton
	-Description
	{}Purpose: Allow the creation of a single instance of a class and provide a way to retrieve it.	
	
-Chapter III 
	[]AbstractFactory
	-Description
	{}Purpose: Encapsulating the choice of concrete classes to be used in the creation of objects from different families.

-Chapter IV
	[]Memento
	-Description
	{}Purpose: Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback).
	
-Chapter V
	[]Visitor
	-Description
	{}Purpose: Allow specific updates on a collection of objects according to the particular type of each updated object.

-Chapter VI
	[]Observer
	-Description
	{}Purpose: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, 
	all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
	
-Chapter VII
	[]Command
	-Description
	{}Purpose: To control the calls to a particular component, modeling each request as an object. Allow operations can be undone, 
	queued or registered.
	
-Chapater VIII
	[]Flyweight
	-Description
	{}Purpose: Share efficiently, objects that are used in large quantities.

-Chapter IX
	[]Multion
	-Description
	{}Purpose: Allow the creation of a limited amount of instances of a particular class and provide a way to retrieve them.
	
-Chapter X
	[]Object Pool
	-Description
	{}Purpose: To allow the reuse of objects.

-Chapter XI
	[]Null Object
	-Description
	{}Purpose: Avoid null references by providing a default object.

-Chapter XII
	[]Active Object
	-Description
	{}Purpose: The active object design pattern decouples method execution from method invocation for objects that each reside 
	in their own thread of control. The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using asynchronous method invocation
	and a scheduler for handling requests.
	
-Chapter XIII
	[]Using Singleton and Memento
	-Description
	{}Purpose: Create a simple text processor using Sigleton and Menento parttners.

-Chapter XIV
	[]Using Singleton, Memento and Flyweight
	-Description
	{}Purpose: Create a simple presentation application using Sigleton and Menento parttners.
	
-Chapter XV
	[]Using Observer and Visitor 
	-Description
	{}Purpose: Create a simple example based on a Stockexchange
